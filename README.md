## What is Frida?

Frida is [Greasemonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey) for native apps, or, put in more technical terms, itâ€™s a dynamic code instrumentation toolkit. It lets you inject snippets of JavaScript into native apps that run on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android.

Frida is an open source software.
