# Awesome Frida [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome projects, libraries, and tools powered by Frida.

## What is Frida?

Frida is [Greasemonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey) for native apps, or, put in more technical terms, it’s a dynamic code instrumentation toolkit. It lets you inject snippets of JavaScript into native apps that run on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android.

Frida is an open source software.
